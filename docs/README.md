# INST377 Final Project

# Title: RecipeMe

## Project Description  
RecipeMe is a web application that helps users search for recipes based on the ingredients they already have at home, helping reduce food waste. Users can view detailed recipe information, find ingredient substitutes, and save their favorite recipes for quick access later. The app uses the Spoonacular API for recipe and ingredient data, and Supabase to store and display users' favorite recipes.

## Target Browsers  
RecipeMe is designed to work on and has been tested on modern browsers, including:

- **Google Chrome** (test on: Version 136.0.7103.114)
- **iOS Safari** (test on: iPhone 16)  

We expected it to work on these browsers as well:
- **Safari** (latest versions on macOS and iOS)  
- **Firefox** (latest versions on Windows/macOS)  
- **Edge** (latest versions on Windows)
